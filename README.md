# dashboard
As a part of the course, I was supposed to make a dashboard where I was able to practice my knowledge of using a grid. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a dashboard in any way as I was inspired by a heroic launcher. The basic concept of this project was preserved as I use grid to layout fake game images and some menu buttons. Images were made by using modjurney.
